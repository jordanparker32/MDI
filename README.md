### 🚀 About

The Mississippi Defense is a program from the United States Department of Defense Office of Economic Adjustment, the University of Southern Mississippi, and public and private sector partners that believe in the promise of a diverse Mississippi economy.

The MDI unites federal labs, defense companies, other private businesses, Mississippi entrepreneurs, Mississippi educational institutions, Mississippi public entities, and domain experts to design, develop, and roll-out strategies to transition from heavy defense-oriented revenue models to commercial revenue models. 

I was hired to rewrite the Front-End and update any information as needed. The Back-End was handled by contractors.
